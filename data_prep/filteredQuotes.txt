   lisa splitsplitsplit  how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt 
   homer splitsplitsplit  what am i a tailor 
   phone operator splitsplitsplit  your call cannot be completed as dialed please make sure you have the correct area code 
  homer splitsplitsplit  area code but its a local call 
   marge splitsplitsplit  the phone company ran out of numbers so they split the city into two area codes half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939 
   homer splitsplitsplit  939 what the hell is that oh my life is ruined 
   marge splitsplitsplit  jeez you just have to remember three extra numbers 
   homer splitsplitsplit  oh if only it were that easy marge   go away we got bigger problems now   
   homer splitsplitsplit    i hate this new area code like i dont have enough to remember already   is that right dont you miss the old 636    carl 
   carl splitsplitsplit  im not sure which ones better the 6 is closer to the 3 so you got convenience there but the 9 has less to do with satan which is a plus in this religious world of ours 
  homer splitsplitsplit  what really burns me up is they didnt give us one word of warning 
   carl splitsplitsplit  what do you mean they ran those tv commercials about it and that big radio campaign 
  lenny splitsplitsplit  dont forget the leaflets they dropped from the space shuttle and the 2 weeks we all spent at area code camp 
   homer splitsplitsplit  not a single word of warning 
  homer splitsplitsplit  its not fair ive been a fan of the who since the very beginning when they were the hillbilly bugger boys 
  bart splitsplitsplit  you should call that radio station and let em have it 
   homer splitsplitsplit  good idea   you little   
   homer splitsplitsplit  uh i have a question phoney 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  its a movie dad 
  homer splitsplitsplit  quiet honey daddys asking the man a question 
   phoney mcringring splitsplitsplit  but how will i remember all those numbers well scientists have discovered that even monkeys can memorize ten numbers are you stupider than a monkey 
   chief wiggum splitsplitsplit  how big of a monkey 
  phoney mcringring splitsplitsplit  ha ha of course youre not 
  homer splitsplitsplit  now im not one to make trouble but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old or   classic 636 area code lives on   the rich side of town

   stephen hawking  splitsplitsplit  i can answer that   ive been tracking a tear on the texture of spacetime which combined with airborne pieces of metal at builders barn to create a miniature black hole this abnormal lead interposed itself between homer and bart causing a gravitational lens which absorbed the light reflected from ray the roofer   
   lisa splitsplitsplit  that seems feasible   
  marge splitsplitsplit  wait theres still one last thing that doesnt makes sense   why did you started fixing our roof and just disappear 
  ray splitsplitsplit  thats easy im a contractor

   lisa splitsplitsplit    
  marge splitsplitsplit  whats gotten into lisa 
   bart splitsplitsplit  beats the hell out of me 
   homer splitsplitsplit  bart 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  mom what are you doing 
   marge splitsplitsplit  what what do you mean 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  dont you remember the eighth commandment 
  marge splitsplitsplit  oh of course its thou shalt not um not covet um graven images something about covet 
   lisa splitsplitsplit    thou shalt not steal 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  dad why is the world such a cesspool of corruption 
   homer splitsplitsplit    oh great   all right what makes you say that 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  well in sunday school we learned that stealing is a sin 
   homer splitsplitsplit  well duh 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  but everybody does it i mean were stealing cable as we speak 
   homer splitsplitsplit  oh look at this way when you had breakfast this morning did you pay for it 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  no 
  homer splitsplitsplit  and did you pay for those clothes youre wearing 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  no i didnt 
   homer splitsplitsplit  well run for the hills ma barker before i call the feds 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  dad i think thats pretty spurious 
   homer splitsplitsplit  well thank you honey 
   lenny splitsplitsplit  hey big fight coming up 
   carl splitsplitsplit  yeah you wanna come over to my house and listen to roundbyround updates on the radio 
   lenny splitsplitsplit  oh yeah okay oh and then after the fight we can watch the still photos on the 1100 news 
   carl splitsplitsplit  not too shabby 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  so even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family that would be stealing 
   reverend lovejoy splitsplitsplit  no well it is if he puts anything on it jelly for example 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  i see 
   reverend lovejoy splitsplitsplit  lisa you came to see me for a reason puzzled tone of voice is your father stealing bread 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  no however he pirated cable so we are getting it for free 
   reverend lovejoy splitsplitsplit  i am afraid that is stealing however the commandments apply to us all and inasmuch as you are to respect the 8th commandment so you must also respect the 5th commandment honor thy father and mother since this is not a situation where your father is harming other people it is not for you to go to the authorities instead i ask that you set an example for your father by refusing to watch any illgotten cable programs 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  hi dad i think stealing cable is wrong so i am choosing not to watch it in the hopes that others will follow my example thats the last youll hear from me on the matter thank you for your time 
   homer splitsplitsplit  hey lisa racing from belmont horsies 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  sorry id rather go to heaven 
  homer splitsplitsplit    theres something wrong with that kid shes so moral why cant she be more likewell not like bart

   homer splitsplitsplit    marge i never put my foot down about anything 
   marge splitsplitsplit  no 
   homer splitsplitsplit  but i am severely tempted to do it over this   
   marge splitsplitsplit  oh homer

   marge splitsplitsplit  no homer not 
  homer splitsplitsplit    its coming down my foot its 
   marge splitsplitsplit  no 
  homer splitsplitsplit  thats it marge the cable stays the foot has spoken

   homer splitsplitsplit    hey go protest outside will ya now

  marge splitsplitsplit  i guess we dont need our chickens anymore 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  dont worry ive already found a research facility that will raise them humanely 
  marge splitsplitsplit  i wasnt worried about that 
  homer splitsplitsplit    if youre going to eat the chickens dont tell the girl 
   barry splitsplitsplit  oh no these chickens are here to advance the cause of science

   barry splitsplitsplit  at exploration incorporated our mission is to help humanity make the next big leap 
  marge splitsplitsplit  thats so fascinating when did you incorporate 
   paul splitsplitsplit  we are preparing to launch the first privatelyfunded manned mission to mars 
  lisa splitsplitsplit    youre going to mars thats incredible   
   homer splitsplitsplit  uh yes how do you plan to solve the problem of eyeball explosion when you take off your space helmet 
   paul splitsplitsplit  uh you leave your helmet on 
   homer splitsplitsplit  hmm these guys seem legit 
   homer splitsplitsplit  what about those mars nutjobs who wants to take a oneway trip to a barren lifeless rock 
  bart splitsplitsplit  yeah in a couple years well have a perfectly good barren lifeless rock right here 
   homer splitsplitsplit  this guy gets it   
  lisa splitsplitsplit  well this mission really gives me hope im tired of nothing but bad news about the future 
  marge splitsplitsplit  yes but to travel to another planet knowing you can never come back youd have to be pretty sad aniston sad 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  im not sad im inspired thats why i volunteered this afternoon 
   marge splitsplitsplit  what 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  the mission leaves in ten years ill be eighteen and im going to mars 
   homer splitsplitsplit  no way young lady we cannot afford to send you to mars 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  its free 
   homer splitsplitsplit    cheaper than college 
   marge splitsplitsplit  no 
   homer splitsplitsplit  no 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  i think this could be my true purpose just let me try out they might not even pick me i mean id pick me but 
   marge splitsplitsplit  absolutely not you are grounded you are confined to this planet 
   homer splitsplitsplit  and its moon 
   marge splitsplitsplit  you know i looked at a map and mars is just one planet over if you really want to try out for this mission i support you 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  really thanks mom if they choose me to be a colonist i could make jazz the dominant music form of a whole new planet 
  marge splitsplitsplit  thats exactly where jazz belongs   
   homer splitsplitsplit  way to turn into the skid baby now watch lisa lose interest in mars just as sure as you gave up on opening that grated comedy club 
   marge splitsplitsplit  i thought gentle jollies was a great idea 
   homer splitsplitsplit  oh not great amazing 
   marge splitsplitsplit   hmm  now that i think about it that idea did have a lot of problems 
   paul splitsplitsplit  greetings candidates the testing that begins today will determine which of you have the necessary skills to thrive on mars 
   barry splitsplitsplit  think of how satisfying it will feel to stand in the valles marineris and thunderchug a blue bronco energy drink   
  pail splitsplitsplit  blue bronco is just one of this missions many corporate partners 
  barry splitsplitsplit  because this is a privately funded entrepreneurial mission weve teamed up with some of americas most exciting brands were talking megacharge batteries fantasylunaticscom trudgerite work boots draftpigs and who here likes fig glutens   
   disco stu splitsplitsplit  what the fig seeds get caught in my adult braces   oh i should not have given away my dog man 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  principal skinner what brings you on this mission to make mankind a twoplanet species 
  skinner splitsplitsplit  mars is the ultimate field trip and all they sell at the gift shop is immortality also im drowning in debt 
   professor frink splitsplitsplit  well i hope to establish a planet of perfect equalityment 
   rainer wolfcastle splitsplitsplit  on mars you are my servant 
   professor frink splitsplitsplit  uh well well either way is good really 
  marge splitsplitsplit  you said if i supported lisas crazy idea shed lose interest 
  homer splitsplitsplit  oh marge youll never understand the female mind were just getting started 
   marge splitsplitsplit  what more can we do 
  homer splitsplitsplit  ive utilized my male mind to come up with a plan so supportive lisa will never want to do anything again 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  what are you guys doing here 
  marge splitsplitsplit  were trying out for mars too we were so inspired by you being inspired 
   paul splitsplitsplit  a family unit could be perfect for this mission nasa would never have the guts to shoot a baby into space   
   barry splitsplitsplit  and your father is a former astronaut what an honor 
   homer splitsplitsplit  last time i almost killed everybody 
   barry splitsplitsplit  and what did you learn from that 
   homer splitsplitsplit  lessons i guess 
  lisa splitsplitsplit    okay mom dad and bart dont want to go to mars so this must be some sort of mindgame reverse superfakeout 
   homer splitsplitsplit    poor lisa she is so faked out 
  lisa splitsplitsplit    and all i have to do is be patient pretty soon theyll get sick of this and quit 
  homer splitsplitsplit    im getting sick of this i think ill quit soon 
  lisa splitsplitsplit    its just a matter of time 
   homer splitsplitsplit    i wonder which one of these two guys is the one i quit to  
  paul splitsplitsplit  marge and lisa congratulations youve both passed with flying colors and will be named finalists in our astronaut search 
  barry splitsplitsplit  marge youre a revelation most of our candidates are of the egghead loner variety bookworms teachers pets friendless middle children that sort of thing   but you display an amazing ability to perform repetitive tasks without getting bored even our robotic arm gets a little cranky   
  paul splitsplitsplit  thats two lorraine  
  lisa splitsplitsplit  admit it the only reason youre here is to support me until i lose interest and quit well im not going anywhere so you can quit 
  marge splitsplitsplit  maybe i dont want to quit do you realize what a big deal it is to be a space colonist 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  yes thats why i want to do it 
  marge splitsplitsplit  i think you dont like that im just as good at mars as you maybe even better 
   lisa splitsplitsplit  ha hardly all you are is a a stayathab space wife 
   marge splitsplitsplit  hmm well it looks like the ego has landed 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  youre the last person i would ever want to go to mars with in ten years 
  marge splitsplitsplit  thats too bad because im going with you in ten years   
   lisa splitsplitsplit  on mars that would be a door slam 
   marge splitsplitsplit  sometimes i feel like lisa has no respect for me 
   homer splitsplitsplit  i know i know 
  marge splitsplitsplit  im finally good at something and she has to make it into a competition 
   homer splitsplitsplit  that must be really hard for you 
   marge splitsplitsplit  it is

  lisa splitsplitsplit  then lets go to mars 
  marge splitsplitsplit  yeah lets go to mars 
  barry splitsplitsplit  ladies and gentlemen mankinds first residents of mars powered by simmertime dinner sauces

   marge splitsplitsplit  i love you sweetie 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  i love you too i dont want to go   
   marge splitsplitsplit  this is the stupidest idea we ever had abort launch   
  paul splitsplitsplit    thats a negative 
   barry splitsplitsplit  i think youre forgetting the motto of blue bronco lets do this thing 
   homer splitsplitsplit  this is not happening do you know how to run the dishwasher 
   bart splitsplitsplit  of course not maybe we can use paper plates 
   homer splitsplitsplit  where the hell do we get those 
   bart splitsplitsplit  mom no 
   homer splitsplitsplit  marge no 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  mom doesnt it frighten you that we almost went to mars out of sheer stubbornness 
  marge splitsplitsplit  thats what a motherdaughter relationship is sweetie a series of nearfatal emotional standoffs 
  lisa splitsplitsplit  okay but it doesnt have to be that way surely we can learn from this 
  marge splitsplitsplit  one day well figure it out on this planet or another

   lisa splitsplitsplit  sergeant skinner was a hero he risked capture many times behind enemy lines 
  ralph splitsplitsplit  teacher made me go to principal skinners office when i was dirty
